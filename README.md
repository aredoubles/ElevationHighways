### Plotting the elevations of interstate highways across the USA

I recently moved from Austin, TX to Boston, MA. It was a four-day drive!

At one point, I found myself on Interstate 80 (I think...), somewhere in eastern Pennsylvania (actually I don't remember exactly, the whole long trip is a blur).

As the highway crested over a mountain pass in the Appalachians, I was struck by the text on a highway sign.

Apparently, I had just crested the highest point on this highway's Eastern section. The next time the highway would reach a similar elevation would be somewhere in Wyoming. I don't actually remember the exact details (I just found this example image on Wikipedia), but I do remember being momentarily awed by the large scales of these highways, that few people get to fully experience.

And for some reason, it reminded me of the album cover for '*Unknown Pleasures*', by Joy Division.

It's an incredibly famous album cover, with [fascinating origins](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/pop-culture-pulsar-origin-story-of-joy-division-s-unknown-pleasures-album-cover-video/).

(I don't actually like Joy Division's music all that much, but the *Unknown Pleasures* cover is just so great)

I thought: wouldn't it be cool to plot the elevations of interstate highways, and then stack them on top of each other, Ã  la *Unknown Pleasures*?

And so this side project was born!

## Workflow

    * Find the routes of cross-country interstate highways in the USA
        * The Google Maps API can find Directions, and I can use that (plus waypoint adjustments) to get the routes of highways
        * Alternatively, find KML files that precisely trace highway routes
    * Encode these routes in a compressed format
        * Google's [Polyline algorithm](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm) is perfect for this!
    * Use the Google Maps Elevations API to find the elevations along these highway routes
    * Plot those elevations!
    * Repeat for all major interstate highways!

## Current progress
    * I-40 has been completed!
        * Lots of manual work involved though
            * Routing done manually (though see Todo below)
            * Route polyline copy/pasted, rather than parsed out

## Todo

    * Wikipedia actually has KML files for these highways!
        * Way more precise than my manual routing!
        * But since the Google Elevations API still requires coordinates or polylines, is there a simple way to convert KML? Preferably in Python.
    * Add more highways, of course
    * Make the plot more attractive
    * Parse out the polyline from the route, right now I just manually copy/pasted it
    * My Google Maps API key is currently made public, which is certainly not good practice, I'll need to import that separately somehow

    * Currently a fellow at Insight Health Data Science, transitioning from academia into a career in data science
    * This is just a side project, for playing around with Google Maps APIs, geoegraphic data, nested JSONs, plotting, etc.
